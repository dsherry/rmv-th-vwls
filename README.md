RMV TH VWLS
=============

A highly necessary chrome extension which removes all the vowels from a page.

Use at your own risk... I mean, s t yr wn rsk, nd gd lck!

This extension can be enabled and disabled quickly by clicking the extension's icon. The extension is enabled when the icon is blue and disabled when the icon is grey with a red slash.

(A word of warning: this extension works great for static pages like Wikipedia, but it doesn't cooperate well with some dynamic sites, particularly ones where you can enter text, such as gmail, google docs. It's not recommended to use this extension if you're doing something sensitive or important, even if it's in another tab or window.)

To install, either:

* [Install the extension in the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rmv-th-vwls/kmjgibnaioofmmplmfhakbnfofjaldhp), or
* Download the source and follow [Google's instructions on how to load the extension in developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
